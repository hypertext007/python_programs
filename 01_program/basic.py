# Line 1: [# Script Begins] In Python, comments begin with a #. This statement is ignored by the interpreter and serves as documentation for our code.

# Line 2: [print(“”)] To print something on the console, print() 
# function is used. This function also adds a newline after our message is
#  printed(unlike in C).

#  Note that in Python 2,
#  “print” is not a function but a keyword and therefore can be used without 
# parentheses. 

# However, in Python 3, it is a function and must be invoked with parentheses.

print("hello word")
#here i worte twinkle twinkle littel star
#here i used \n 
#\n :- the use os \n is enter in new line 
#"\t" is a tab,  (1)\t = 4 space
#"\n" is a newline,
